	/**
	 * Class used to store and/or return Application config settings such as
	 * the server name and port for the website along with the
	 * FlashRemoting channel and amf endpoint uri settings
	 * 
	 * This class allows you to dynamically set your configuration for 
	 * your flex/swf file on a website of your choice.
	 * 
	 * You do not need a -services compiler argument for the project and
	 * therefore no need to recompile your project code if you
	 * shift your code to different websites.
	 * 
	 * A context root default value is provided as a constant.
	 * 
	 * An amfphp endpoint default value is also provided as a constant.
	 * 
	 * The following flashVar variables can be passed if user wants
	 * to override default values. Examples below
	 * 1) contextRoot="/nimphp/";
	 * 
	 * NOTE: This class is called after applicationComplete and not 
	 * creationComplete(URLUtil unable to get server name at this stage).
	 *
	 * This class is geared for a php based server where a ContextRoot 
	 * function currently does not exist(whereas these functions
	 * do apparently exist for Java and coldfusion based servers).
	 * 
	 * To bypass this function limitation, the contextRoot should be
	 * defined as a constant in a php include file and then have the
	 * include file loaded in the php calling file using the 
	 * require_once feature. This constant can then be passed in as a 
	 * flashVar value if needed(if different from the default value
	 * defined below)
	 *
